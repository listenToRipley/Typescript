# Typescript - Understanding Generics 

Generics are away to to constrain a type by requesting the same time the is input as a param returns that same type. 
You can identify a generic by the use of `< >`

#### Generics and JSX
With generics, you need to include a comma in the first <Type,> like so. Or else it will be seen as an incomplete JSX text.
